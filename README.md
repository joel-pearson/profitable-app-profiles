dataquest project01: Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

---

This project aims to analyse IOS and Android app data to help developers gain a better understanding of what type of apps are likely to attract more users on both Google Play and the App Store.

The main focus of this work is to develop my own understanding of data science and apply what I have leanrt so far on my dataquest data science journey to a realistic data analysis application.
