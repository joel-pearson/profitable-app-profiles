dataquest project01: Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

---

This project aims to analyse IOS and Android app data to help developers gain a better understanding of what type of apps are likely to attract more users on both Google Play and the App Store.

The main focus of this work is to develop my own understanding of data science and apply what I have leanrnt so far (on dataquest) to a realistic data analysis application.

Project Spec:

"*For this project, we'll pretend we're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We make our apps available on Google Play and in the App Store.*

*We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the number of users of our apps determines our revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.*"
